A calculator website which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the website. For example, user A and user B go to your site at the same time. User A calculates "5 + 5", which equals "10". This is logged below the calculator as "5+5 = 10". User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates "3x_4". This calculates to 12 and displays "3x_4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it. Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest.



app-wide state:
- array of size 10
- each new calculation takes index 0, all other calculations get moved, calc at index 9 goes away
- state of this array persists


user:
- name
- array of calculations (string format is fine)


calculator:
text box, select operation, text box, equals sign, display answer

(select operation)
drop down
scroll that allow you to select
buttons, click on choice

Components:
- welcome
- create user_profile
- calculator
- calculation_display

- General welcome
  + if {no_user_profile}:
      - display{welcome_component}
      - {create_profile_component} display
- once profile is created, calculator displays as well as prior calculations
  + else if {user_profile} display {calculator_component}
- each user profile keeps state of calculations done by that person [string]
- app-wide state - keeps array of last 10 calculations, newest goes at index 0 [string] (hot refresh any new calculations)
- app-wide state persists
